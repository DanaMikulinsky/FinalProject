What should you do?
undertaking
When contacting an emergency room for one of the reasons exempted from payment in accordance with the State Health Law, it is not necessary to contact the medical center (branch) for a pledge. The hospital will charge Maccabi directly for the cost of the emergency visit

The documents will be reviewed and, depending on the reason, the Maccabi will issue an obligation and determine whether a deductible is required. The medical center will contact you up to 3 working days from the date of arrival of the documents
reimbursement
In the event that you have contacted the Maccabi hotline and from there you were referred to the ER and admitted to the hospital, you will be given a credit for the fee you paid at the Maccabi hotline. For this purpose, an application for reimbursement must be submitted to the Maccabi, together with the following documents: an invoice and receipt from the hotline, a summary of a visit to the center where it is indicated that you were referred to a hospital, and a letter of discharge from hospitalization

What else is worth knowing?
The medical care provided in emergency rooms involves a fee, according to the tariff of the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health has defined cases that are exempt from payment of the fee or part of it.
