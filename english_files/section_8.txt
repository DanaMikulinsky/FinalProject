050-8566307 (also possible on WhatsApp) What should you do? Get a referral from a neurologist, psychiatrist or doctor licensed by the Ministry of Health for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD and hyperactivity disorder. On the seal of the doctor should be written his field of specialization or his being authorized by the Ministry of Health for the diagnosis of ADHD.
The referral should be brought with you at each stage of the diagnosis (with Ritalin and without Ritalin), unless it is indicated in the doctor's referral that it is for both parts of the diagnosis and includes a prescription for Ritalin. 
Make an appointment in advance directly in front of the clinic.
Arrive at the clinic with a Maccabi card or other ID. You can get the service at the clinic by “visiting without a card” on the Maccabi Online website and in the Maccabi app or at the Maccabi hotline non-stop *3555 - extension 8 from a mobile phone registered in Maccabi.
What else is worth knowing?
The diagnoses are only auxiliary, which is part of the overall diagnostic process.
Eligibility is for the diagnosis only and does not include the summary call. The findings of the diagnosis will be deciphered by the attending physician.
 
The entitlement from “Maccabi Shelli” can be exercised once and is not renewed after a while. If necessary, another type of additional diagnostics can be carried out within the framework of eligibility from Maccabi Zahav
A member who has performed TOVA or BRC within the framework of Maccabi Zahav, can perform another type of diagnosis within the framework of Maccabi Shelli with self-participation in the amount of 25.60₪. Further diagnosis can be made only after accumulating a 6-month seniority in Maccabi Shelli.
If you are entitled to medical treatment or reimbursement or participation for medical expenses under the following laws, the service will not be provided under the additional health care services:
 
HURT IN HOSTILITIES RECOGNIZED BY SOCIAL SECURITY
Disabled Ministry of Defense 20% or more
Injured in road accidents
 
If the need for the service is not due to the violation recognized by the laws listed above, a letter from a doctor confirming this must be submitted to the office of the medical center (branch), in order to obtain permission for the realization of eligibility.
The letter can be submitted in an envelope to a queue or sent by registered mail or email to the medical center. Locating a Medical Center >
All of the above is subject to the additional health care regulations in Maccabi.
